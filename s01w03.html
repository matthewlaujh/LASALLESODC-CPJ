        <p class="dissertation-content">
            Was feeling quite stuck with working out my dissertation topic so I had a quick chat with Johnson from last year's
            batch, Johnson has been one of my closest friends since our Diploma days and has always been a great idea sparring
            partner and I thought that a good sparring session would help clear my head alittle. Below is an excerpt from our casual
            text conversation edited for easier reading.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            While in the stage of writing your RPO and early stages of Dissertation, how did you look at defining a
            user group for the research objective? (Shared with him some feedback I received from the last consultation.)
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            For my RPO I had managed to define a scope of research, simply exploring decay as a material treatment, where
            I am challenging designers to see materials differently. There is a method : Decay as a process. There is a problem : 
            Dominant notion of material treatment (Industrialisation)
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Would that be considered a practice-based dissertation method?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yes, I mentioned to Yasser that I wanna explore and challenge the methods. Then Yasser say that it could 
            be practice based led.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            I think a rough summary of the idea that I have so far is Method: Physical Computing as form of 
            Interaction Design. Problem: Dominant shift toward screens in today's climate.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Your method and problem, personally I feel there is potential to be better, now it's lacking the wow factor.
            You need to bring a wow factor to the supervisor, interesting enough yet do-able. For me, Like Decay, was done by MIT, 
            so I got a backing for my research and it's not just a random idea. Practice based is the idea of reflection in action.
            See is there any methodology that interest you and Singapore could do/ lacking, Then challenge that method and geek out.
            Take an interesting concept/method from MIT/somewhere, challenge it and make it your own. The umbrella is the 
            concept/method of material ecology for me, I took one case study = decay by design Aguahoja the I put it into 
            Singapore's context. Now you are introducing him to a method(physical computing-interactive) and a outcome/goal (play).
            Its like me saying I wanna do decay(method) to fertilise (outcome), but the RPO is proposing what you wanna research and 
            on who.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Interaction design is the concept, physical computing is the method. Does that make sense?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay now you got physical computing, put play aside, Don't be too focus on interactive first, because 
            physcial computing has it potential to bring you to places, by adding interactive in now might hinder its potential,
            Vikas gave the idea of introducing physical computing into daily objects and connecting them to each other is a route.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            For me, I think everything boils down to these being a form of non-verbal communication. So using the 
            concepts of (interaction design) throught the method (physical computing) for non-verbal communication.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            If its non verbal communciation makes it more interesting ahahaha, Its like muted interactive, Just sight touch 
            smell and interaction. If you remove one sense it changes the whole interactive design ball game.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Non-verbal doesnt just mean that its no sound, its more of referring to communication not through words.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Can can, then you have to define what is non verbal communication. no need speech or simply no sound? Just lights? 
            Does it undermines or create a new experience? What is is your research challenging?

            I am challenging the dominant shift to screen based interaction in today's society, especially in the current 
            climate, everything is shifting towards screen-based interactions.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>

            This is part of my literature review last semester "Advances in media have led to a technological and 
            ultural transition in the field of telecommunications, with more mediums becoming viable for exploration in the 
            form of experimental means of communication. As affordances through networked technologies have redefined how 
            people perceive each other and shaped the way people interact daily, it has led to the proliferation of screens 
            in today’s world, reducing tactility in interaction and the ability to communicate sensorial and emotional beats, 
            bringing about the need for a material-centered approach to interaction design."

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            That's interesting, material centered approach to interaction design. Its simple and nice but it needs
            to be developed further. Do you have any case study to this?

            It's on my <a class="dissertation-quote" href="https://matthewlauresearchcompendium.cargo.site/" target="_blank">

            That sounds like useless machines.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Jodi's is also technically useless machines. But it inspires coding students, But to accountants or 
            office workers its useless lol That will determine what is the message you are trying to bring across. What if 
            the lecturer's ask: Why non verbal? - muted? Why material centered approach? -what specific kind of material 
            and why?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So screen based interactions mainly focus on video, speech and text, verbal forms of communication. 
            So challenging that notion of verbal communication, with non-verbal communication. Why material approach?
            Due to the nature of screen based interaction, it lacks tactility in interaction. Hence the need for material approach.
            So what material? Referring to my literature review from last semester "As mentioned by Wiberg (82) 
            “"Interactions" means actions in between two or more entities; the entities can be a user and a computer, 
            but they could also be any other sets of entities.” A material-centred approach to interaction design 
            looks at designing across many substrates and how contemporary interaction design is about getting various 
            materials to work in unison. Through the materiality of interaction, digital artefacts can manifest many 
            different forms of interaction. "If we think of this process as a postrepresentational paradigm of interaction 
            design, the implication is that computing is no longer only about representing reality (as it follows from the 
            representation-driven paradigm), but it is actually part of reality (and in that sense "postrepresentational") 
            (Wiberg 84) ."".
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            That's good, Love it when it says digital is like representation while computing is part of reality,
            Love it.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah so like digital screens are merely representational but through physical computing we can attain 
            a sense of reality in interaction. Maybe I can use one of these statement as like an anchor point, like the
            Neri Oxman statement that you used to anchor yours?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Neri Oxman statement was materials should be everchanging, adaptable and living amongst the environment. 
            So she creates new materiality by exploring that notion. Using decay. At least this is what my project leverages 
            on. For that statement that you mentioned, it's just like a comment, not really a method. It's more like the spark 
            to your problem.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            I also really like this statement "A material-centered approach to interaction design cannot only be 
            about digital materials. On the contrary, Contemporary interaction design is about the configuration of multiple 
            materials to work in concert. Interaction design thus becomes a practice of designing acrross a multitude of 
            substrates.(Wiberg 82)".
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            It’s like introducing materials and computation to orchestra an experience. What if you take a step back,
            It might help you to step away from outcome driven/ unconsciously driving your project into finding ways that 
            you could explore/experiment. Because you would be thinking about what to do/ what to explore / how to make it more 
            interesting / challenging. Then your project statement would naturally be outcome driven. Cause your statement right now,
            sounds very outcome driven.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah that's true, it sounds like it's describing what i want to work towards making.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay start from asking yourself what spark you from choosing computation?
        </p>
        
        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            I was instantly hooked, when Andreas introduced the Yo-Yo Machines project to me, its such simple artefacts,
            and like the efffect/interaction is so minor but it manages to communicate this notion of telepresence, 
            simultaneous actions, shared experience and remote presence, challenging the subtleties of long-distance 
            communication and changing how people interact and communicate. Just by letting people send one another nonverbal, 
            expressive signals like lights, sounds or simple mechanical movements.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay now, how can you make this project yours? In your own personal life or Singapore context. The second part
            is outcome, avoid that for now. These words are interesting "Simple artefacts, effects minor, somehow communicate sense of ...".
            It's sort of like my decay. So how to make it your own? Changing how people interact and communicate?
        </p>
        
        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Basically the two main case studies, Yo-Yo Machines and Here and There both somewhat achieves this idea.
            They mention that "The global pandemic has forever changed how we work, learn and play, making virtual communication 
            the primary form of human interaction."
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So Covid-19-19 restrict physical interaction?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yes, but i've been reluctant to use Covid-19-19 as a premise, even though yes it's part of the background, and like,
            without a doubt it's a driving force for the change in these screen based interaction norms. So I feel like it could be a
            primer statement but it should not be the focus of the background. As I feel that yes, due to Covid-19, it has led to this
            shift towards screen and it has changed social norms and that is here to say, but all this is possible due to affordances
            that have allowed this change to happen. I just feel like Covid-19 is a very "lazy" problem to reuse at this point, especially
            one/two years into this pandemic, its been done time and time again especially in my case studies. So it's more about looking
            at the lasting effects that have come into existence due to the pandemic.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ahhhh but you know it’s undeniable that Covid-19 is the trend setter lol ahahahahaha. I remember Stanley 
            once said to my project. A unfortunate event could be an opportunity as well. To rethink our way of living. In my 
            project case is anthropogenic the age of humans makes us rethink the use of materials. Covid-19 is a new era, rethink 
            about? No need for office. More interaction between families? More divorce? Less interact with friends but more 
            with family? True that it shouldn’t be the focus of your problem. Actually the supervisors said before your project 
            don’t have to be problems. It could be opportunities. Most people’s projects are problems first. Too many Screen based is 
            like a problem.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah Vikas mentioned that something interesting about this project could be looking at the hint of possibility
            and that ties into this thing I love about one of my case studies, NYU ITP, cause they call themselves the center of the
            recently possible.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            The way your approach your project changes everything. Problem/opportunity. Mine is more towards opportunity.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            That's one way to think of things, opportunity wise, I think there's great opportunity in how accessible these
            physical computing parts have become, and how easier it is to find help online, basically the idea of open-source. So like
            it could be because of this access and like the shift towards screens that is like an opportunity to solve a problem?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            I mean it’s not wrong, but not really convincing though. Cause it’s like two different things trying to mash 
            together. I think we're both tired, lets talk about this again later.
        </p>

        <p class="reflections-content">
            My talk with Johnson was a rather productive one for me, I figured out that parts of my approach were wrong and
            also that there could be a way to work iterations of my experiments with Arduinos into the dissertation through
            a practice based method. I just need to figure out how.
