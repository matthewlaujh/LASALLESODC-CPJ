        <p class="appendix-header">// General Appendix</p>
        <p class="appendix-content">This section is for me to add more stuff post-submission (I understand if they don't count towards my 
          submission, I feel that although these do not have a direct relation with my current project, it's still good learning points for me 
          to keep track of as it helps further my knowledge in creative coding and computation.), throughout the semester I have partially
          attended two really interesting festivals, the first being <a class="appendix-content" href="https://ars.electronica.art/news/en/" target="_blank"> Ars Electronica 2021</a>
          and the second is a creative coding symposium,<a class="appendix-content" href="https://www.instagram.com/iterations.online/" target="_blank">Iterations 2021</a>.
           I managed to partially watch some of the talks going on but have not had the time to digest the information. I managed to get the Video on Demand
          for the talks that I have interest in and will continue to update this section with my thoughts and learning points over the break.
