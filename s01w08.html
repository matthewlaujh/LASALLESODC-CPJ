          Hi Vikas and Andreas, if you're reading this during Week Seven CPJ Work Check, just thought I would leave a note to sort of
          summarise the semester so far and kind of map out the gaps that I've left through the first seven weeks and how I intending on
          fixing those (plot) holes. I think project week would be a good time to catch up on things, I've been feeling quite burnt out this semester
          (which actually sort of inspired part of this research into feelings, as I've shared a couple of weeks back),
          so I'll probably take the weekend off to rest and recharge then from monday it's back to work. 
          So starting off, honestly I'm quite glad with how the research and practice have been going but
          for research wise I need to dig deeper into Affective Computing and as I've mentioned in Week Four, I have a To-do list of
          videos to watch and papers to read (well this is the research equivalent of looking at examples and case studies, cause the
          research labs primarily release papers on them instead of just project pages online), and that's probably the first thing I would
          be tackling this project week along with revisiting some of the Ars Electronica content. For Ars Electronica, I watched parts of them
          but mainly due to it being late at night and or early in the day, I've missed out on quite abit, and so I would have to revisit the full
          recordings before I can write about them. I'll do this slowly over the next few weeks, but they're not priority right now as some of 
          this knowledge is just good to know. The research, RPO and experiments will come first. Then as for experiments, I'll be attempting to look
          a little closer at the data gathered during my experiment during the cohort seminar presentation and share my findings on that more.
