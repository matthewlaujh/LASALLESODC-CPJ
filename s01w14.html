          After last week's consultation with Andreas (sorry no transcript this time, I had bad internet connection and was unable to record),
          some key takeaways was that now that I've developed so many different things, what's the best way to present them? How will they be used?
          What's next from here?
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Taking cue from the "what's the best way to present them?", I thought it would be quite nice to compile all of them into a microsite
          with proper documentation, circuit diagrams and the code ready to be uploaded so that I could refer back to them easily whenever I needed 
          to. And so to keep things simple, I've named this "archive", "A Series of Explorations & Technical Challenges", literal I know. After
          going through my whole list of explorations, I've group them into what I call "Technical Challenges", each technical challenge represent a
          function that I wanted to explore and then the explorations are the steps that I undertake to beat that challenge and do it.

            Initially I typed it out in the Arduino IDE cause I was looking through my sketches, hence the "/* */" and "//" but I like them,
            I think they can be really nice little elements to be used in the "branding" for lack of a better word? for this series.

          With the explorations grouped and named the next step was the presentation, I knew I wanted to mount the circuits on acrylic, after working on
          that project with Dhiya a few weeks back I found that I really liked the look of the circuits on acrylic. I hoped to use the workshop in the
          basement to cut them but the technical officer said that "It's a very busy few weeks" and he could not conduct an induction for me. However,
          luckily Dhiya told me that Andreas's Laser Cutter in the media lab was operational again and that was a life saver. I am really thankful
          for Dhiya telling me about it and helping me with it as well as Andreas for allowing me to use it.
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          I actually did have some experience with that particular laser cutter, back in diploma Dhiya introduced it to us and I had used it to cut and engrave a
          few label tags for my final year project then, and look at me now using it again for a final year project now, things really come full circle huh. I
          started preparing the files, I actually managed to remember that the strokes had to be 0.001 point, RED (255,0,0) for cut, BLACK (0,0,0) for engrave.
          But the one thing I forgot was how to layout the things to be cut, I had spaces in between each piece and hence the machine would have to go
          over an area twice, but if i combined the shapes together it would only have to make one cut making things quicker.

          Next I had to pick what colour acrylic to use, I didn't really want a clear one cause I wasn't the biggest fan of the see through,
          since this was already an exposed circuit, I also didn't want something too shiny or reflective, So I had to look at matte options.
          I decided to use orange cause I think the colour of the Arduinos would be a nice contrast to the orange background and laser engraving
          words on orange should look quite good. Luckily my friend had some samples from DAMA so I could see each different type of orange before 
          I made my choice. I had him take a photo of them with flash and with a backing so that I could see how they reacted to light. I ended up
          picking PLF 9923 cause I like that it didn't reflect too much light and the frosted look made for a nice texture.

          Alright time to get to cutting. Dhiya helped me out and gave me a refresher on how things worked and how to set things up.

          I had to make a choice did I want to save time and just lightly cut (using lower power) the outlines of my text or did I want
          to engrave the the solid text. Engraving would take a very long time compared to lightly cutting and I did a sample to just compare
          the two methods. (Image below) the top was the engraved text and the bottom was the lightly cut text, well although from far they
          looked similar, up close you could see that the text had weird spaces due to the outline? So ultimately I ended up choosing to
          engrave the text. It took a really long time (see bottom right image) that was the rough amount of time it took to cut one set of
          labels, I had two sets. I was in the laser cutter room for about 6 hours cutting the two sets of labels and another 2 hour to do
          the tests and set things up. But totally worth it.

          So... funny coincidence, after cutting one set of labels as I took out the remaining acrylic to put with the other scraps,
          it so happened that I paced it in front of the scrap of Andreas's moving arm and well (image below), they're the exact same
          orange. I swear I did not plan this or even thought of it. Maybe subconsciously? After having seen it in class and in the
          lab so often? Maybe? But I've been using orange in a lot of my projects too. Well, just a funny coincidence.

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          I also cut out pieces to build a few covers for my prototypes just to see how the light would react being covered and Dhiya
          taught me a way to put the pieces together without using clamps. It's actually using the tension of masking tape to hold
          the right angles in place. That's a pretty nifty way to do it. I also realised that the laser cutter struggled to engrave small 
          dots like "."s, I found a few of them missing and had to either draw an outline around it to make it thicker for the cutter to
          register them, which is why some of the dots look abit bigger. So this is something to take note of in the future.

          I also found one of these circuit "brains" as Dhiya calls them that he and Andreas worked together on for iNCH's performance
          at Art Science Museum. I thought it was really smart to have cut out slits for the cables to run through and that could be something
          I could look into doing in the future.

          After a long 8 hours of cutting, here's the finished product. I really liked how things turned out I think these will make for
          very nice documentation next week when I put the circuits together. The laser cutter really is a great tool for prototyping, especially
          if I want to look at working with kinetic objects next semester. Andreas please let me use it again, thank you!

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Just a quick update here regarding all the code I've written, since I'll be documenting everything properly and creating that archive
          site, I also took the chance just to go through all the code from the previous explorations and either copied and tidied them up or
          rewritten them more "efficiently" or "neatly" or just "better-ly", and have annotated some key functions just to help give context to the code functions
          based on whatever new knowledge I have now. I won't be embedding the code here as they will be embedded on the microsite later on.
          Doing this really helped refresh my memory on some of the earlier explorations and sort of serves as like a test for myself to see
          if I have learnt anything over the semester (spoiler alert: I did). Really very satisfied with myself doing this, even more so cause I managed
          to do it without having to refer to online samples, just based off what I had and my knowledge.

          Drew circuit diagrams for each of the explorations, pretty straightforward stuff here, I know I could just use fritzing to
          generate the diagrams but I wanted to stylise them to suit my art direction for this archive so I just had to go through the
          slightly tedious process of tracing out the components but, drawing them myself allows me to take liberties with things like
          the breadboard (removing unused holes so that lines could run through) and I could draw them with as much (or little) detail
          necessary. Although one thing that I would do differently here (and I might just do it over the break, maybe) is to draw it on
          a grid, For this version I was just tracing images of the objects and trying to match scale, but I realised that that made it
          hard for me when I was trying to "run wiring" across the boards and it got a bit messy, so there might be a better way to
          approach this. Since I can reduce or add details, maybe I can stylise it further and draw things on a grid so that it would look
          better and be neater.
