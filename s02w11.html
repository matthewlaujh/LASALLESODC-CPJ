          Since the open studio set up was not the full experience, I wanted to do a quick render so that people could see what the idea was. I talked to Shaiful and he suggested that since I had rendered 
          out the 3D Model of the space in Rhino I could try using Rhino to do the lighting effect. I looked up some tutorials on youtube and between the tutorials and consulting the product design guys on
          how to use keyshot I managed to get out a really quick and dirty render. It's not the best but it gets the idea across.

          It was really fun learning a new software and I think it's a really important tool especially if I want to do more installation work in the future. It's for sure something that I would want
          to learn more in the future together with Rhino.

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          One key thing to takeaway from building the open studio prototype is to not make the mistakes of the previous iteration. The previous iteration had badly soldered connectors and I didnt hot glue
          them to seal the connector points. I will not make that mistake again.

        But other than that the construction of the open studio prototype was pretty smooth, I laser cut the holes for the acrylic and for the wood, Since i was using a 15mm blockboard I couldn't laser cut
        but i engraved the points on the wood and went to the workshop to drill them.
