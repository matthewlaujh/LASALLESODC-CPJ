        <p class="gradproj-header">// Bonus - Compilation of Research from Y2S1 till Y3S2</p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          I spent quite abit of time on this outcome and I'm quite satisfied with it but it's still incomplete but after consulting Vikas about it we agreed that it is best to leave this for later.
          It's a compilation book of all my research pertaining to this research topic from Year Two Semester One all the way till Now. I am about 3/4 way through but we decided that it was too
          precious a book to complete in a rush and I should really take my time to get it right and also find someone to proofread all the text as I am planning on using this as my dossier to apply
          for a Master's program in the future. But if you're interested here's a link to the wip pdf: <a class="gradproj-content" href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/55c069da-4c39-4220-86ea-6c269a7bf1ed">AFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION WIP</a>
