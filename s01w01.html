        <p class="dissertation-content">current idea → purveyors of creativity culture → playful and fun not just stress and hardwork → 
          turning facebook/google model into smaller items of play → base foundation to communicate/interact alternatively to traditional channels → 
          main objective to engage in something playful and productive, interactive, engaging, reactive, cta/response, It's all about communication. 
          Communication goes back and forth till the flow stops, a two way channel but the channel can break. Thresholds where communication starts 
          and stops. Communicate tangibly or intangibly, communicate over time, communicate for response or communicate for understanding. Purpose 
          of communication is to enlighten/alert something to someone. Human ability for understanding. Inherent to communication in work. 
          Email/text phone can transmit message, but this form of communication is experiential and pushes the boundary of messages to become a norm. 
          Communicate through the experience because traditional forms of communication is just not enough. How the person reacts or understand is 
          very important. e.g i read a text, im aware or alert but that's it. e.g pay raise in text is just a number but a pay raise + pat on the 
          back or celebration, is tapping on sensorial experience to enhance the "experience". emojis prove that expression is already better than 
          text, so take that one more step further. Obtrusive and Unobtrusive "paging". WFH, you can't see your colleague's state of work, so there's 
          another layer to consider. Look at workplace practices, conduct interviews to find out established processes. See how these artefacts can 
          enhance the communication experience. Look at various forms of communication from the past of present, then look at contemporary and 
          futuristic forms of communication. Communication → Creative Culture → Technology → WFH → Creative Culture → Communication (Is a cycle flow) 
          Look at how tech can enhance or improve previous technology. Recycle and rehash old forms of communication with tech implementation. 
          What we had, what we have, what's next? Daito Manabe, both people are hooked up and then one can alert the other through it, hand connected, 
          then auto write note. Connecting senses to precedent of communication. Internet of things, connect to household products to evoke experience 
          and senses. Always keep on testing your hypothesis. Pave the way for the tech to be used, help people understand. Map out carefully and justify. 
          Justify why creative industry.</p>
