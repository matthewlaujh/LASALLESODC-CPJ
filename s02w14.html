        <p class="gradproj-header">// 11.04.22 - 14.04.22 - Exhibition Set-up.</p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Firstly I'd like to shout out Shaiful Hardy (you remember him right, he's appeared in my CPJs quite abit) for helping me bring the pieces down to the basement from D301 and also Sufiyan from ICAS
          for helping with the set-up. I couldn't have done it without them. I think it was really helpful having Sufiyan there, firstly cause well the gallery is kind of his turf and he has so much experience
          setting up works, he really helped showed me the ropes and I learned so much working with him on setting up.
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Firstly, I was totally overthinking my mounting option. I wanted to drill through the wall and have 4 long M6 Screws extended out and then hook the work on and tighten it with nuts, but he felt 
          the weight of the artefacts and said that using two D Ring hooked onto two short screws was enough to support the weight (spoiler alert, he was right, it didn't fall). Secondly when choosing the
          height of which to hang the artefact and to mount the information panels, he shared with me that to get eye level view, it was around 155cm high and also that when hanging work on the wall,
          do not hang in the middle of the height, always do it at 3/4 high, so that there would be a slight pleasing slant making it a better angle for viewing. Those were things that I didn't know before this
          but it's probably time for me to change the mounts of the photo frames in my room at home now. Although now thinking about it, I just realised that the hooks for picture frames, aren't in the middle
          or at the top, they're 3/4 high...interesting...!!
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          With his help we managed to do the hard parts (mounting onto the wall) within a couple of hours, while the next few days were spent refining the setup and space doing stuff such as cable management
          and just slight adjustments to make everything work well. Speaking of cable management, shout out to Hani for helping me with, his experience as a production grip came in handy here, we managed to
          hide the cables in the tracks on the ceiling neatly!
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          I've gotta thank Sufiyan for loaning me a couple of the gallery spotlights as well, they really helped enhanced the whole exhibition, initially when we set them up they lit up a wider area than I
          expected but then he passed me the light shapers and its so cool, you can adjust the spread of the light, the shape and even the softness of it. Made the whole experience feel like I was really
          setting up for a proper exhibition and not just a school showcase, if I can call it a showcase? 
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-header">// 14.04.22 - Exhibition Opened.</p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Finally had some people come and check out the exhibition for the first time and I think everyone really enjoyed themselves, as I was explaining my work to everyone the general feedback was that
          everything look good, although some issues do pop up here and there where the system could not recognise their faces, but as I've found through my practice based research for dissertation, the
          machine learning mode is not perfect. These issues tend to happen and it's also because different people's natural expression differ from each other slightly. Although there are cultural norms
          where a smile would typically mean happy and frown would be sad, individual understanding of how these faces are made also differ. That got me thinking that it could be an interesting next phase
          of research that I could potentially undertake myself after graduation or even when I hopefully/eventually do my masters.
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Yeah this reminds me of the whole Affective Computing as an informational model part of my research where there are datasets and information that determine different emotions but also from an
          Affective Presence point, the cultural norms and interpretations would shift based on the interactions so it might be interesting to look at how these two concepts can be further bonded together
          in the future. Currently the project already is an amalgamation of the two concepts where Affective Computing provides the input and Affective Presence is the output, but how can I further
          bridge them together? 
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Please enjoy some photos that won't make it into the website/book documentation. Also this is proof that people actually came hahaha, I think I had around 40 people come down and check it out, so
          that was pretty cool. About 1/4 of them are my friends outside of school, 1/2 of them were classmates and the other 1/4 were actually some juniors in the diploma programme that i've gotten to know,
          so hopefully this project can inspire them to do something fun if they ever come back for their degree.
        </p>

          <p class="gradproj-header">// 15.04.22 - Filming and Documentation of Exhibition.</p>
          
          <p class="gradproj-content">
            I decided to take quite a "run and gun" approach to filming but well also with a bit of planning so i'm not sure if it's still considered run and gun but basically the plan for the video
            is to film two videos. One is a concept film showing the narrative of the installation it'll be a bit more conceptual while the other video is more focused on the flow of the exhibition to
            give people a preview of the space or for people who are unable to check it out in person. 
          </p>

          <img class="gradproj-content" src="assets/images/semester-two/s02w14/video-planning.JPG">
          <p class="gradproj-caption">Image: Rough sketch planning of video.</p>

          <p class="gradproj-content">
            I decided to "cast" my friend ody in the video, mainly because my dissertation was dedicated to him and another friend J-Lin, cause it was their struggles with emotions that inspired me 
            to kind of take this route with my research in the first place, it was unfortunate that J-Lin wasn't in Singapore to be a part of the video so I just got ody and another friend to help out.
            Another friend helping out was Hani who assisted as my DP/GRIP/CA for the shoot, so that I had some assistance with handling the camera and I could tap on his film background, so I could focus on directing the talents and making sure
            the tech was working. So I would frame the shots then shift to the tech station while Hani would help to roll camera. I also thought it was quite smart that we used the TV as a light source when
            it was too dark for some shots to get the lighting that we wanted.
          </p>

            <p class="gradproj-caption">Image: Filming the video.</p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          I think the pseudo run and gun method worked out, minimal planning means we had the freedom to adjust framing and narratives while on set to see what could work best. It was good that there was a
          rough outline, but if we had planned too much, I think things might have been too rigid. Some good practices that I picked up from Hani was also that we should always get at least 3 takes, it's good to
          keep the camera rolling for a bit before and after the shot.
