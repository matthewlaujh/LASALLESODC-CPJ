          The first time I documented the circuits I had them on a product table, it was a white glossy background that wasn't flat, admittedly
          I was not the most prepared for this shoot and just ran with it only to go home feeling super disappointed with the look of the videos
          and so I decided to reshoot it once again later in the week. I mean it wasn't bad (embedded one video below), but I just think it could
          be so much better?
        </p>

          But first some learning points, firstly, This whole process of shooting was a test of my ability to put together circuits, also
          on the stop code debugging, so when I rewrote all the code I didn't actually run them, I was waiting for now to run them
          and so some of them, just some, were SLIGHTLY buggy and had to be fixed on the spot. But this is where the earlier steps helped out majorly,
          having all the codes in one folder labelled and ready to go was very convenient and then having circuit diagrams for each circuit to be able
          to refer to, major help.
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          The second time around I am much more prepared to shoot, I brought a nice sheet of black colorplan paper from RJ that I had in my
          room since I was documenting my diploma portfolio. Planned out the order in which I had to dismantle and reassemble the least amount
          of parts between circuits, assumed all the code was working (this will come back to haunt me in a bit), worked out a way to get a nice flat
          lighting for my flat lay. But turns out, well murphy's law, for some reason a bunch of the code had issues again, even though I resolved them
          during the first shoot and did not make any changes. So no matter how prepared I was, I still wasn't prepared enough. But atleast the videos
          turned out great. I'll keep it a surprise and not embed it here (unless you're reading this after you've seen the microsite then well...).

          Not going to lie, putting the website together was probably easiest part of this whole documentation process. All the assets
          were in place and I used a "simplified" version of Andreas's folder convention from last year's live project, so it was pretty
          quick putting the site together on cargo.
