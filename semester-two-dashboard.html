          Hey and welcome to Mathew's Creative Process Journal! This journal contains both aspects Graduation Project
        </p>

        <p class="appendix-content">
          Also hi, Matthew from one day before submission here, initially I had an alternative way of doing cpj this semester using webflow and some plug-ins for video etc, 
          but I just realised that it wasn't working out the way I wanted it to (really should have checked), so this is me around 12 hours before submissions, porting all my content over to this cpj, and uploading everything 
          to instagram so that I can embed them, so sorry for the sudden instagram spam (I know both Vikas and Andreas follows that account). Also if you see me tomorrow looking like a zombie,
          you know why. But oh well, the fault is on me for not checking earlier :(...
        </p>

        <p class="appendix-content">
          Hi again 6am Matthew here, Im trying my best to copy things over but some weeks are missing because of the mess up and I had to redo them together with the recent weeks that I have to catch up on
          I really do not think that I can complete things in time, Im so sorry this is a really bad look on me but I'm trying. There's just been so much going on but I'll do what I can. I have decided to
          not upload the videos first and focus on putting images and texts in first because instagram is being really slow with the uploads and there's some issues. But once again the fault is on me. I'm trying...
        </p>

        <p class="appendix-content">
          730am Matthew just want to say my final sorry, I've done what I can and have to head to school in abit for submissions. Thanks for everything the last two years, really hate that I have to end
          the year on a downer...
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Same as last sem, Graduation Project content is styled as such and it covers aspects of experimentation and physical "doing" of things.
          It covers the exploration and documentation as well as reflections and learning of the activities explored through the
          research. Also just a quick note, some of the Instagram Embed for "Reels" have this weird effect where it as an image of the video
          below the video that is playing, I can't fix that so I'm so sorry. But I think it would be better to view the Instagram videos on your
          phones while you're reading the CPJ. Sorry for the inconvenience! (Hi matthew from 3 hours before submission here, i might not be able to upload the videos in time, im so sorry. This semester has been hectic)
        </p>

        <p class="appendix-content">
          The dates are labelled as working days from Monday to Friday each week and it looks like I have the weekends off, 
          but...weekends are for further troubleshooting and updating the CPJ, so... :(. Actually as I've been working on the
          CPJ. I realised that it's hard to keep track of the days spent on a specific things (besides consultations and presentations),
          so the dates aren't exactly accurate at this point, but maybe just think of them as like the day things started and not that
          they were completed during that day.
