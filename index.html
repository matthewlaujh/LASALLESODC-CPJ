        <p class="appendix-content">
          Hey and welcome to Mathew's Creative Process Journal! This journal contains both aspects of Dissertation and Graduation Project,
          as they are interlinked with each other and collectively they inform the course of study for the year.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-content">
          Dissertation content is styled as such and although it's labelled as Dissertation it's expanded to cover all aspects of research,
          concept and other written content covered through both modules.
        </p>

        <p class="gradproj-content">
          Graduation Project content is styled as such and it covers aspects of experimentation and physical "doing" of things.
          It covers the exploration and documentation as well as reflections and learning of the activities explored through the
          research. Also just a quick note, some of the Instagram Embed for "Reels" have this weird effect where it as an image of the video
          below the video that is playing, I can't fix that so I'm so sorry. But I think it would be better to view the Instagram videos on your
          phones while you're reading the CPJ. Sorry for the inconvenience!
        </p>

        <p class="appendix-content">
          The dates are labelled as working days from Monday to Friday each week and it looks like I have the weekends off, 
          but...weekends are for further troubleshooting and updating the CPJ, so... :(. Actually as I've been working on the
          CPJ. I realised that it's hard to keep track of the days spent on a specific things (besides consultations and presentations),
          so the dates aren't exactly accurate at this point, but maybe just think of them as like the day things started and not that
          they were completed during that day.
