            Took a deeper dive into affective computing and realised that

        <p class="dissertation-header">06.09.21 - Chat with Johnson.</p>

        <p class="dissertation-content">Yet another chat with Johnson about my topic, you'll probably
            be seeing his name pop up alot over the course of the year.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So basically where the topic is at is that "An exploration of affective communication through a 
            material-centered approach to interaction design of physical computing artefacts."
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ouhhh interesting, Sounds cool, This sounds clearer to me. Don’t know whether I got the wrong 
            idea or not. Affective communication with a machine AHHAHA so interesting, Machine having emotions.
            Jodi wanted to mimic students by expressing fear through machine. Then Guo Wen asked her to capture 
            the sense of fear is the key for her installation. JUST PROPSE. INTERESTING.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
        Almost there, but it's actually more of using machines to interpret and simulate emotions.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ouhhh, emotion here is tricky, cause machines have no emotion. But there are people out there trying to replicate
            their "emotion" into machines. Just propose it.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            That's basically affective computing. Could you take a read "31.08.21 — 03.09.21 - Some wild thoughts" of my cpj 
            just to get caught up with where I've progressed with the topic? I've further researched and it has led to 
            "An exploration of affective communication through means of remote communication to communicate stress and burnout."
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ouhh so you're bringing mental health into the picture.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah I think that's a logical next step for affective computing, it also helps provide a context for things.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            When you introduce another element into the topic would make things more interesting, but it also means there 
            needs to be some science/proof behind it. Means might need to interview people from mental health related areas 
            for your disseration.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yes there is some research going on with regards to stress at the MIT level and Microsoft research level. This has
            been quite well documented within the field of Affective Computing but that might also means that it won't be anything new.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Hmmm I mean it has quite a lot of potential. But you must distinguish the fine line between a designer and a mental 
            health doctor. Cuz MIT got a multidisciplinary team doing it. You a lone designer must define what is the scope and 
            intent of your research. Are you designer through just a lens of a designers (speculative). Or will you be working 
            with people with mental health knowledge. Can propose but that is what the lecturers asked me when I was researching 
            about materials. Something very out of a design communicator comfort zone. Just need to clear with the scope and see 
            whether viable or not.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yes, ok so i did do some thinking about that. I think the line is drawn where i will attempt to explore a means of 
            communicating the stress. So i am not trying to get you to not be stressed or trying to predict your stress level,
            I will be looking at ways where when you're feeling stressed, you can communicate it to someone else. Sort of something
            like a "buddy-system". Maybe it could be a way of sensing when you're stressed by you interacting with something/
            the surrounding and then that gets communicated to your buddy who will then check in on you? Need to explore further.
            It could also just be something that you trigger to alert someone.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So it through behavioural detection to determine the stress level? Or self-triggered>
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Well I mean that's left to the research to inform me. I'm quite limited working alone as you've mentioned, I'm no
            inter-disciplinary team that can tackle everything. But for me I think I just have to remember to tie it back to
            the aspect of communication as that's my anchor back to design commmunication. So there's this focus on finding a way
            to communicate my affective state.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So since you are in the topic of stress/depress are you trying to link it to the recent spike of Singapore's 
            mental health states? Just wondering
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Well yes I did somewhat consider that, but so far my link to mental health came from the premise of Affective Computing
            which was about using computing to help advance human wellbeing by developing new ways to communicate, understand, 
            and respond to emotion, which was already somewhat forming the basis to mental health.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So maybe your disseration could be studying whether would affective communication through physical computing be viable 
            to the mental health industry?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ok so viable as in like devices to aid the mental health professionals? Feels like that's abit out of my ability and
            scope. Which brings me back to my focus on communicating. From what I've seen, affective computing is very useful to
            people on the autism spectrum who have issues communicating how they feel, and a bulk of research has been done in that
            field. So what I was thinking was that could this same idea, help people communicate through the stigma of mental health?
            People don't like to verbally talk about such issues, so could there be another way?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay then you as a designer, knowing this information, what can you do? or what do you wanna do? Inform people? 
            Inspire people? Educate people?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Help people, maybe even empower people? I want to create this outlet of help instead of just talking about it or
            raising awareness. I want to use computation to explore this means of this “aid” that can be used and interpreted 
            by people. I know that there's no way I can find a "solution" but I can sure explore ways to go about it, whether or not
            it's effective that's another thing all together. But atleast trying would be good? So now I’m thinking about just 
            providing this outlet for means of communicating these affective states. Cause it’s not something that’s easy to communicate.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay so the aid is to what extend? Cuz stress, anxiety, depression though they maybe interwined or connected, they 
            differs. Also in different age group and context would be different as well. Mapping out your boundaries is important also. 
            Too broad makes the project diluted. Are you trying to explore artefacts for the consumers/people to help them OR 
            are you trying to explore opportunities for the mental health associations as an alternative solution?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            For people to help them. Cause I think I have to start small here, cause i'm no neuroscientist or psychiatrist,
            I'm also not an engineer or computer scientist, so exploring opportunities for the mental health industry would be
            a far fetch from where I'm standing now.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah, then how could you say that it would help them? AHAHAHHA With that the lecturers might question about the 
            mental health part. So the phrasing of your intent is important. Sometimes the research might says its possible, 
            but how to prove that your artefact could help others? The part about mental health industry, maybe its possible, 
            because there is a gap in the mental health sector that there are not using machines to help people. Is there a reason
            for that? Is it because we are too slow or does it not work? There has to be a GAP. You dont have to achieve, its proposing.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Affective computing has actually been applied in the US, atleast as a point of research. Here are some links:
            <a class="dissertation-quote" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-for-the-assessment-of-severity-of-depressive-symptoms/overview/">
            AI for assesing depressive symptoms</a>, <a class="dissertation-quote" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/skinbot-a-wearable-skin-climbing-robot/overview/">
            Wearable skinbot</a>, <a class="dissertation-quote" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/bioessence/overview/">
            bioessence</a>. Yeah so this isn't that new a field in this aspect, there are some documentation and those are just the
            MIT examples, there's also studies done by places like Microsoft Research. So I was thinking of leveraging on those ideas
            but work on it in a different way.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Oh yeah its not new anymore huh, Okay for now, you can just propose this idea first, But be clear about affective communication.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah so, a one year BA research won't be able to even touch that level, so I was thinking of just taking those ideas,
            and then starting out small. Just the aspect of communicating such issues.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay if the lecturers ask you what is the gap that you are trying to fill, what would it be?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            The gap would be the stigma of people not communicating their affective states? Due to the subtleties of
            remote communication, such details would often be overlooked.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            For the mental health part, your scope is very important. Cause if you say you wanna help people, that's contradicting 
            cause we are designers not doctors. There might be wicked problem. Just worried that the lecturers would not be as 
            keen. BUT if you funnel it down to secondary students education and stuff would be more do-able. It is affective
            communication like buddy system but not into the physiological area of anxiety and depression. There is a gap for 
            that because there is a rise of sucidal rate in Singapore cuz education too stress and stuff. Because of covid transition 
            being so different, schools cant handle and stuff. Then that would not be too indepth on mental health but rather 
            the well being. Be it to help of detect or whatever solution that one leave it to later. As a designer, now you have to 
            define your gap, area of research and why.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-content">
            Ok so after some deliberating and thinking I've broken down the aspects of the project as such.
        </p>

        <img class="dissertation-content" src="assets/images/dissertation-notes/dissertation-notes-1.jpeg">
        <p class="dissertation-caption">Image: Breakdown of the idea. Without the mental health context.</p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            I get that it should dive into the whole psychological thing cause that's not our area as designers. So yeah 
            its more of just being able to communicate these affective states. What happens next is another issue for another 
            bigger brained person.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah that right and what and who are you trying to address through the means of affective communication.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So the what am I communicating is back to Affective Computing and that is the term of human emotions and related
            phenomena. That's already the idea of communicating feelings, emotions and moods. It's just the who.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Judging from that comment, you are good to go uh. Can have something in mind, but open to change if research states 
            otherwise.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Do you think the context can be determined after the research? So basically I focus the research on communicating
            affective states, then from there I progress into how it could be applied? So basically through a series of various
            experiments, I gather feedback regarding them and then I say blah blah blah this could potentially be applied to 
            blah blah blah. So the research is focused just on the way affective states are being perceived and communicated.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So what you are saying now is similar to what I did, where things are done concurrently. Meaning have to do research 
            while doing experimentations to explore possible innovations. Need to have context and backing to back your experiments.
            The thought process behind your practices is cruical. The answer is Yes uh. But have to complete your school work too 
            ahahahhaa need to balance. Start the experiment early and do it at your own pace. Okay meaning your thought process is 
            something like: Research(reading/secondary research) > experimenting > Information gathered from experiments > 
            got questions > Go back to the start. Like a lot of back and forth. But to do that, requires lots of time. Also remember
            to be flexible to changes.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Also maybe like cause the level that the other places do affective computing is intense like engineering level, so
            there might be some value at looking at things from a simple computing artefact standpoint. So maybe this could make
            such artefacts more accessible and so that even non-engineers can build them. 
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            At this point you can have a few variations. Just propose them and see what feedback you get.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Rephrasing things, I think this would be a good starting point now before proposing the different variations. 
            An exploration of communicating affective states as form of interactions for challenging the subtleties of remote 
            communication through notions of telepresence and remote presence.
