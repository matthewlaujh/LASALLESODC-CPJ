        <p class="dissertation-content">Yet another chat with Johnson about my topic, you'll probably
            be seeing his name pop up alot over the course of the year.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So basically where the topic is at is that "An exploration of affective communication through a 
            material-centered approach to interaction design of physical computing artefacts."
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ouhhh interesting, Sounds cool, This sounds clearer to me. Don’t know whether I got the wrong 
            idea or not. Affective communication with a machine AHHAHA so interesting, Machine having emotions.
            Jodi wanted to mimic students by expressing fear through machine. Then Guo Wen asked her to capture 
            the sense of fear is the key for her installation. JUST PROPSE. INTERESTING.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
        Almost there, but it's actually more of using machines to interpret and simulate emotions.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ouhhh, emotion here is tricky, cause machines have no emotion. But there are people out there trying to replicate
            their "emotion" into machines. Just propose it.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            That's basically affective computing. Could you take a read "31.08.21 — 03.09.21 - Some wild thoughts" of my cpj 
            just to get caught up with where I've progressed with the topic? I've further researched and it has led to 
            "An exploration of affective communication through means of remote communication to communicate stress and burnout."
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ouhh so you're bringing mental health into the picture.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah I think that's a logical next step for affective computing, it also helps provide a context for things.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            When you introduce another element into the topic would make things more interesting, but it also means there 
            needs to be some science/proof behind it. Means might need to interview people from mental health related areas 
            for your disseration.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yes there is some research going on with regards to stress at the MIT level and Microsoft research level. This has
            been quite well documented within the field of Affective Computing but that might also means that it won't be anything new.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Hmmm I mean it has quite a lot of potential. But you must distinguish the fine line between a designer and a mental 
            health doctor. Cuz MIT got a multidisciplinary team doing it. You a lone designer must define what is the scope and 
            intent of your research. Are you designer through just a lens of a designers (speculative). Or will you be working 
            with people with mental health knowledge. Can propose but that is what the lecturers asked me when I was researching 
            about materials. Something very out of a design communicator comfort zone. Just need to clear with the scope and see 
            whether viable or not.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yes, ok so i did do some thinking about that. I think the line is drawn where i will attempt to explore a means of 
            communicating the stress. So i am not trying to get you to not be stressed or trying to predict your stress level,
            I will be looking at ways where when you're feeling stressed, you can communicate it to someone else. Sort of something
            like a "buddy-system". Maybe it could be a way of sensing when you're stressed by you interacting with something/
            the surrounding and then that gets communicated to your buddy who will then check in on you? Need to explore further.
            It could also just be something that you trigger to alert someone.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So it through behavioural detection to determine the stress level? Or self-triggered>
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Well I mean that's left to the research to inform me. I'm quite limited working alone as you've mentioned, I'm no
            inter-disciplinary team that can tackle everything. But for me I think I just have to remember to tie it back to
            the aspect of communication as that's my anchor back to design commmunication. So there's this focus on finding a way
            to communicate my affective state.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So since you are in the topic of stress/depress are you trying to link it to the recent spike of Singapore's 
            mental health states? Just wondering
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Well yes I did somewhat consider that, but so far my link to mental health came from the premise of Affective Computing
            which was about using computing to help advance human wellbeing by developing new ways to communicate, understand, 
            and respond to emotion, which was already somewhat forming the basis to mental health.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So maybe your disseration could be studying whether would affective communication through physical computing be viable 
            to the mental health industry?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ok so viable as in like devices to aid the mental health professionals? Feels like that's abit out of my ability and
            scope. Which brings me back to my focus on communicating. From what I've seen, affective computing is very useful to
            people on the autism spectrum who have issues communicating how they feel, and a bulk of research has been done in that
            field. So what I was thinking was that could this same idea, help people communicate through the stigma of mental health?
            People don't like to verbally talk about such issues, so could there be another way?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay then you as a designer, knowing this information, what can you do? or what do you wanna do? Inform people? 
            Inspire people? Educate people?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Help people, maybe even empower people? I want to create this outlet of help instead of just talking about it or
            raising awareness. I want to use computation to explore this means of this “aid” that can be used and interpreted 
            by people. I know that there's no way I can find a "solution" but I can sure explore ways to go about it, whether or not
            it's effective that's another thing all together. But atleast trying would be good? So now I’m thinking about just 
            providing this outlet for means of communicating these affective states. Cause it’s not something that’s easy to communicate.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay so the aid is to what extend? Cuz stress, anxiety, depression though they maybe interwined or connected, they 
            differs. Also in different age group and context would be different as well. Mapping out your boundaries is important also. 
            Too broad makes the project diluted. Are you trying to explore artefacts for the consumers/people to help them OR 
            are you trying to explore opportunities for the mental health associations as an alternative solution?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            For people to help them. Cause I think I have to start small here, cause i'm no neuroscientist or psychiatrist,
            I'm also not an engineer or computer scientist, so exploring opportunities for the mental health industry would be
            a far fetch from where I'm standing now.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah, then how could you say that it would help them? AHAHAHHA With that the lecturers might question about the 
            mental health part. So the phrasing of your intent is important. Sometimes the research might says its possible, 
            but how to prove that your artefact could help others? The part about mental health industry, maybe its possible, 
            because there is a gap in the mental health sector that there are not using machines to help people. Is there a reason
            for that? Is it because we are too slow or does it not work? There has to be a GAP. You dont have to achieve, its proposing.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Affective computing has actually been applied in the US, atleast as a point of research. Here are some links:
            <a class="dissertation-quote" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-for-the-assessment-of-severity-of-depressive-symptoms/overview/">
            AI for assesing depressive symptoms</a>, <a class="dissertation-quote" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/skinbot-a-wearable-skin-climbing-robot/overview/">
            Wearable skinbot</a>, <a class="dissertation-quote" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/bioessence/overview/">
            bioessence</a>. Yeah so this isn't that new a field in this aspect, there are some documentation and those are just the
            MIT examples, there's also studies done by places like Microsoft Research. So I was thinking of leveraging on those ideas
            but work on it in a different way.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Oh yeah its not new anymore huh, Okay for now, you can just propose this idea first, But be clear about affective communication.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah so, a one year BA research won't be able to even touch that level, so I was thinking of just taking those ideas,
            and then starting out small. Just the aspect of communicating such issues.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Okay if the lecturers ask you what is the gap that you are trying to fill, what would it be?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            The gap would be the stigma of people not communicating their affective states? Due to the subtleties of
            remote communication, such details would often be overlooked.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            For the mental health part, your scope is very important. Cause if you say you wanna help people, that's contradicting 
            cause we are designers not doctors. There might be wicked problem. Just worried that the lecturers would not be as 
            keen. BUT if you funnel it down to secondary students education and stuff would be more do-able. It is affective
            communication like buddy system but not into the physiological area of anxiety and depression. There is a gap for 
            that because there is a rise of sucidal rate in Singapore cuz education too stress and stuff. Because of covid transition 
            being so different, schools cant handle and stuff. Then that would not be too indepth on mental health but rather 
            the well being. Be it to help of detect or whatever solution that one leave it to later. As a designer, now you have to 
            define your gap, area of research and why.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-content">
            Ok so after some deliberating and thinking I've broken down the aspects of the project as such.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            I get that it should dive into the whole psychological thing cause that's not our area as designers. So yeah 
            its more of just being able to communicate these affective states. What happens next is another issue for another 
            bigger brained person.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah that right and what and who are you trying to address through the means of affective communication.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So the what am I communicating is back to Affective Computing and that is the term of human emotions and related
            phenomena. That's already the idea of communicating feelings, emotions and moods. It's just the who.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Judging from that comment, you are good to go uh. Can have something in mind, but open to change if research states 
            otherwise.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Do you think the context can be determined after the research? So basically I focus the research on communicating
            affective states, then from there I progress into how it could be applied? So basically through a series of various
            experiments, I gather feedback regarding them and then I say blah blah blah this could potentially be applied to 
            blah blah blah. So the research is focused just on the way affective states are being perceived and communicated.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So what you are saying now is similar to what I did, where things are done concurrently. Meaning have to do research 
            while doing experimentations to explore possible innovations. Need to have context and backing to back your experiments.
            The thought process behind your practices is cruical. The answer is Yes uh. But have to complete your school work too 
            ahahahhaa need to balance. Start the experiment early and do it at your own pace. Okay meaning your thought process is 
            something like: Research(reading/secondary research) > experimenting > Information gathered from experiments > 
            got questions > Go back to the start. Like a lot of back and forth. But to do that, requires lots of time. Also remember
            to be flexible to changes.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Also maybe like cause the level that the other places do affective computing is intense like engineering level, so
            there might be some value at looking at things from a simple computing artefact standpoint. So maybe this could make
            such artefacts more accessible and so that even non-engineers can build them. 
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Johnson Tan</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            At this point you can have a few variations. Just propose them and see what feedback you get.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Rephrasing things, I think this would be a good starting point now before proposing the different variations.

            Research Background:
        </p>
        <p class="dissertation-content">
            The global pandemic has made lasting changes in the way we work, learn and play, making virtual communication the 
            primary form of human interaction. This has led to the reducing of tactility in interaction, losing the subtleties of 
            affective states in communication. There has also been a reduction in physical presence. As meaningful social 
            interactions and relationships are at the core of human wellbeing, there is a need to look at alternative means of 
            staying socially connected, especially during the gaps where face-to-face communication is less available.
        </p>
        <p class="dissertation-content">
            As affordances of computing has given way to access to easy to use software and hardware, there is the possibility
            of looking at the use of these systems to bring access to reduced forms of affective computing to be comprehensible
            by persons outside of the field of affective computing.

            Possible methods include an inquiry into existing Literature and Case Studies as means of a research framework informing
            the design of possible experiments. As well as conducting experiments through Quick and Dirty Prototyping 
            with a small Usability Testing group to gather feedback and then iterating based on the feedback receieved.

            For the prototyping, might want to elaborate on it. Also be mindful that the term "Quick and Dirty",
            is not universal, although I also do use it because it helps you understanding it immediately, like just use
            cardboard or styrofoam. Also because sometime you just need something that people can hold and role play. Might
            want to elaborate on the tools and processes that you are using and it's ok if you revise it later as it gives you
            a starting point.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>

            Yeah it's probably necessary as for now it's probably just quick simple Arduino experiments to get the ideas acrross
            and see if it works.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            And for those who are doing something open-ended, you might want to think about how you would want to scale it,
            so that it's realistic for you as a student research as it's one person, not an entire team. And if you have an
            idea of how you might want to workshop it, you can put it down even if it's rough. But I think just be mindful,
            cause I know it's abit confusing for now I think because prototyping is the main objective, you don't have
            to sort of think of it as Usability Testing. Because Usability Testing, often can confuse you also, because it feels
            like something that can come abit later, when things are more resolved and at this moment you're looking more at
            feasability, looking at what's possible and what's doable.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Could it be just like a series of prototypes that just serves as like a proof of concepts that this thing is or might
            be possible, and then self evaluating it.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah that's one way of looking at it, and you can come up with like a matrix of what you think you're trying to evaluate.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So I don't have to get people to test it out, because for now logistically it sounds quite hard because of having to
            go through the iterations quickly and where it's always changing, for now.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah, but what you need is you need a starting point, so even if let's say you have a matrix right, it doesnt have to be fully
            fleshed out, even for those who are doing research methods like "Interviews", you don't need to like a full interview
            list of questions, you just need a starter kit, so that anyone looking at it can have an idea of how you are going to
            get started, and then maybe this iteration will influence the next iteration.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah so it's like hitting certain criterias.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            So the next thing is that some of these concepts are good like "Telepresence" and "Remote Presence", but I'm not sure
            if those are still the terms being used, cause those seems like terms that have been used for a really long time.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah I'll double check those but if I'm not wrong, recently they are still in use. It's just one of those terms that
            has been carried through the years.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah but they do relate to remote communication. Actually that's all I have, but it's good that you've cleaned it up.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah so I think that's referring to how it could be used, then whether it's something to be used.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Hmm I don't have an issue with questions, cause for let's say for Li Qian's one, he also has a very broad question,
            which I think it's ok, but as long as you don't have something where you jump ahead too quickly as I've mentioned. 
            For his one it's trying to look at sound as an alternative for something, I told him, you can do that for anything
            like wind power is an alternative for oil and gas, as long as you're not trying to jump too far ahead. Although, I'm
            not too sure about the wording of "easy to use and easily accessible".

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            How I came about that, cause that's still subjective, it's actually because I came from Affective Computing which is
            not the most accessible thing right now because of how it relies heavily on engineering and robotics and such. So maybe 
            it's about scaling Affective Computing down to a manageable level where people can just experiment with that.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Oh thanks for that detail, you might want to add and simplify the question with regards to "easy to use and easily 
            accessible" you might want to collapse that abit but and you might want to add for whom?
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah that's something I'm still trying to figure out.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            I mean for now like I said it's still a broad question, so it might just be for non-experts or users to bridge digital
            literacy. So just to be clear it's not about educating people, it's just a bridge. Like I think for Olivia's case is that
            she's looking at interfaces, so anytime it's an interface. So interface is a really interesting concept, as when I was
            in architecture, glass is an interface. It's such an interesting material, it's clear right, the idea is that the
            glass is a break between indoors and outdoors. If you smash through the glass you're outdoors already, you can see right
            through it. There are people who have written philosophical texts about different qualities of glass, in different 
            situations it can also be a way of seduction. Like lets say you look at these full glass that they use in bathrooms,
            when they start to fog up because of the steam. It's a very interesting material. So for over here you're looking at
            something that is tangible, and it's affective. There's ways to look at it as interfacing between things or user
            groups. But the reason I'm ok with these questions is because maybe in November or December you could fine tune it,
            and maybe it's about a particular application or context within which.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Ok cause actually I've explored some further routes where it kind of touches into abit of communicating mental health
            states, or stress. As those are very big studies within Affective Computing, but then I think there's a problem where
            there's a line between the scope of a designer and how feasible projects in this field will be.

            One quick suggestion would be maybe you're working with someone. So last year there was a student who was working on
            OCD, Natasya. So you have to work with someone on it, cause at times you would be making assumptions, some of which
            might be things that have been disproven in the art therapy community or therapy community.
        </p>

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Matthew Lau</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            Yeah so like it's not within our scope and then you have to find the line and like thread around it.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            It's not impossible but yeah you do need to work with someone.

        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            But I think for what I have now it's quite a fair bit of work, so it's a good point to start and see where it
            takes the project.

        <p class="dissertation-quote-name">Vikas Kailankaje</p>
        <p class="dissertation-quote">
            But as you experiment, maybe you can decide what qualities and attributes you want to focus on. I think previously
            you said something to do with play, which is also something that's quite broad. I think after all Andreas might also
            tell you that anything can be play, but even though he encourages play, his way of doing it is just to get you to get
            going first. But yeah I'm ok with what you have now. Just don't forget that you're a student and your learning should
            be captured in your dissertation also.

        <p class="dissertation-content">
            It's good to finally be able to progress with the RPO, with Vika's comments some key takeaways were that it was possible
            to further the research topic after initials experiments and that for now it's looking at possibilities as creating proof
            of concepts that can in turn further the research down the road. It is also important to evaluate these experiments and
            figure out a way to view them objectively. There's also possible room for research of these interfaces between different
            user groups. But for now as a starting point it'll be good to do as many experiments and then deciding what qualities and
            attributes that I want to focus on. Also all learning shold be captured in my work, try not to leave anything out.
